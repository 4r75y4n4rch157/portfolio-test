                                <p> Disappointing hues of white walls and grey machinery serve to sedate the workers. Mentally. Emotionally. Spiritually. Sedated. Conversation is minimal at best.
                                    Weather, sex, food, how they will be sedated when they get home with drugs and alcohol. Sports if they want to get excited. Only at special times are families
                                    discussed. No one is happy to be there. No one chose this life on purpose. </p>

                                <p>I am made sick by your coddling support. 
                                    I wish to be stripped naked, body mind and soul. 
                                    Left exposed for all to see. 
                                    Revile my intellect and charm, exult in my flaws, my scars, my pain. 
                                    This is my heart, exposed for you, this is my soul, broken so you could see how it all fits together. 
                                    I want to see the naked disdain on your face, as clearly written theere as a desert is baron. 
                                    Give me no sustinence, I will eat your hatred, give me no water, I will drink your disdain. </p>
                                <p> I've put the question to task on enough people to know the regular answers. I've even heard a few outlandish and thought provoking ideas thrown into the mix. One thing I neglected to do was ask myself, so recently I did just that. I asked myself “why did you stop believing in God?”. I really didn't know at first, for quite a while, actually,  and  it bothered me. Then one night I talked to my best friend about our mutual father situation and it became very clear to me why I don't. I simply don't want to. If there is a God, then this is all on purpose, he knows, he sees, and doesn't give a shit. I can't worship a being like that, or even believe in one. The concept is idiotic and counter to everything I know. Personally it's even worse. I have the intellect, an indomitable will, strength of character, and a plethora of other exceptional traits. It seems though that I have no motivation, and the only thing my will can't overcome is me. </p>
